Apna Coding - Installation Guide
Welcome to the Apna Coding open-source project! This guide will walk you through the steps needed to set up the project on your local machine so that you can start contributing to this exciting platform.

Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

Git: For version control and cloning the repository.

Download from: Git Download

Node.js: For running the back-end (JavaScript) and front-end server.

Download from: Node.js Download

npm (Node Package Manager): This comes with Node.js and is used to manage dependencies.

Installed automatically with Node.js.

MongoDB: For managing the project database.

Download from: MongoDB Download (if you plan to run it locally; for cloud setup, we use MongoDB Atlas).

Code Editor: Recommended to use VSCode or any code editor of your choice.

VSCode Download: VSCode

Step-by-Step Installation
1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the Apna Coding repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/APNA-CODING-BY-APNA-COUNSELLOR/Apna-Coding-Platform.git
After cloning, navigate into the project folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd apna-coding
2. Install Dependencies
Front-End
If you're working on the front-end (React, HTML, CSS), navigate to the frontend directory and install the dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd frontend
npm install
Back-End
If you're working on the back-end (API, server, database management), navigate to the backend directory and install the dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd backend
npm install
3. Set Up Environment Variables
The project requires several environment variables to run properly. In the root directory of the project, create a .env file (if it doesn‚Äôt already exist) and add the following environment variables:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Front-end environment variables (optional)
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000

# Back-end environment variables
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/Apna-Coding-Platform
PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
Replace the MONGO_URI with your MongoDB connection string (use MongoDB Atlas for cloud setup).

Replace JWT_SECRET with a random string to securely sign JWT tokens for authentication.

4. Run the Project Locally
Front-End (React)
Navigate to the frontend folder and start the React development server:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd frontend
npm start
This will open the front-end of the platform at http://localhost:3000.

Back-End (Node.js & Express)
Navigate to the backend folder and start the Node.js server:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd backend
npm start
This will start the server at http://localhost:5000.

5. Open the Application
The front-end of the platform will be available at http://localhost:3000 (React application).

The back-end will be running on http://localhost:5000 (API, server).

Now, you can access the full application locally and start making changes.

Running Tests
We use Jest for unit and integration testing. To run the tests:

Navigate to the project directory.

Run the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm test
This will execute the test suite and show the results in your terminal.

Contributing to the Project
1. Fork the Repository
Fork the repository by clicking on the ‚ÄúFork‚Äù button at the top right of the GitHub project page.

2. Create a New Branch
Before starting to work on any feature or fix, create a new branch for your changes.

bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout -b your-branch-name
3. Make Your Changes
Work on your feature or bug fix. If you're working on front-end changes, navigate to the frontend directory, and for back-end changes, navigate to backend.

4. Commit Your Changes
Once you're happy with your changes, commit them to your branch.

bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
5. Push to Your Forked Repository
Push your changes to your forked GitHub repository.

bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin your-branch-name
6. Create a Pull Request (PR)
Go to the main project repository on GitHub.

Click on ‚ÄúPull Requests‚Äù and then click on ‚ÄúNew Pull Request‚Äù.

Choose your branch and compare it with the main branch of the original repository.

Write a description of the changes you've made and submit the PR.

Troubleshooting
Here are some common issues you might face during setup:

Issue: "npm command not found"
Solution: Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed correctly. Run node -v and npm -v to verify their installation.

Issue: "MongoDB connection error"
Solution: Ensure MongoDB is running locally (if you‚Äôre using MongoDB locally). You can start it using mongod command or use MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based setup.

Issue: "Error: cannot find module"
Solution: Run npm install in both the frontend and backend directories to ensure all dependencies are installed.
